The Department of Education collects [annual statistics on colleges and universities in the United States](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/). I have included a subset of this data from 2018-19 in the [`rcis`](https://github.com/cis-ds/rcis) library from GitHub. To install the package, run the command `remotes::install_github("cis-ds/rcis")` in the console.

{{% callout warning %}}

If you don't already have the `remotes` library installed, you will get an error. Go back and install this first using `install.packages("remotes")`, then run `remotes::install_github("cis-ds/rcis")`.

```{r}
#| label = "scorecard"
library(rcis)
data("scorecard")
glimpse(scorecard)
```

Type `?scorecard` in the console to open up the help file for this data set. This includes the documentation for all the variables. Use your knowledge of `dplyr` and `ggplot2` functions to answer the following questions.

## Which type of college has the highest average SAT score?

**NOTE: This time, use a graph to visualize your answer, [not a table](/notes/transform-college/#generate-a-data-frame-with-the-average-sat-score-for-each-type-of-college).**

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

We could use a **boxplot** to visualize the distribution of SAT scores.

```{r}
#| label = "sat-boxplot"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = type, y = satavg)
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

According to this graph, private, nonprofit schools have the highest average SAT score, followed by public and then private, for-profit schools. But this doesn't reveal the entire picture. What happens if we plot a **histogram** or **frequency polygon**?

```{r}
#| label = "sat-histo-freq"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = satavg)
) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(type))

ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = satavg, color = type)
) +
  geom_freqpoly()
```

Now we can see the averages for each college type are based on widely varying sample sizes.

```{r}
#| label = "sat-bar"
# observations with non-NA SAT averages
scorecard %>%
  drop_na(satavg) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type)
  ) +
  geom_bar()

# what proportion of observations have NA for satavg?
scorecard %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize(prop = sum(is.na(satavg)) / n()) %>%
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(x = type, y = prop)
  ) +
  geom_col()
```

There are far fewer private, for-profit colleges than the other categories. Furthermore, private, for-profit colleges disproportionately fail to report average SAT scores compared to the other categories (likely these schools do not require SAT scores from applicants). A boxplot alone would not reveal this detail, which could be important in future analysis.

## What is the relationship between net cost of attendance and faculty salaries? How does this relationship differ across types of colleges?

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r}
#| label = "cost-avgfacsal"
# geom_point
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = netcost, y = avgfacsal)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_point with alpha transparency to reveal dense clusters
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = netcost, y = avgfacsal)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_hex
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = netcost, y = avgfacsal)
) +
  geom_hex() +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_point with smoothing lines for each type
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = netcost,
    y = avgfacsal,
    color = type
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth()

# geom_point with facets for each type
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(
    x = netcost,
    y = avgfacsal,
    color = type
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(type))
```

## How are a college's Pell Grant recipients related to the average student's education debt?

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

Two continuous variables suggest a **scatterplot** would be appropriate.

```{r}
#| label = "pell-scatter"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Hmm. There seem to be a lot of data points. It isn't really clear if there is a trend. What if we **jitter** the data points?

```{r}
#| label = "pell-jitter"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_jitter()
```

Meh, didn't really do much. What if we make our data points semi-transparent using the `alpha` aesthetic?

```{r}
#| label = "pell-alpha"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2)
```

Now we're getting somewhere. I'm beginning to see some dense clusters in the middle. Maybe a **hexagon binning** plot would help

```{r}
#| label = "pell-bin"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_hex()
```

This is getting better. It looks like there might be a downward trend; that is, as the percentage of Pell grant recipients increases, average student debt decreases. Let's confirm this by going back to the scatterplot and overlaying a **smoothing line**.

```{r}
#| label = "pell-smooth"
ggplot(
  data = scorecard,
  mapping = aes(x = pctpell, y = debt)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth()
```

This confirms our initial evidence - there is an apparent negative relationship. Notice how I iterated through several different plots before I created one that provided the most informative visualization. **You will not create the perfect graph on your first attempt.** Trial and error is necessary in this exploratory stage. Be prepared to revise your code again and again.
