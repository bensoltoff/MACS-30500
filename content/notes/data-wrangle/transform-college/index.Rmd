The Department of Education collects [annual statistics on colleges and universities in the United States](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/). I have included a subset of this data from 2018-19 in the [`rcis`](https://github.com/cis-ds/rcis) library from GitHub. To install the package, run the command `remotes::install_github("cis-ds/rcis")` in the console.

{{% callout warning %}}

If you don't already have the `remotes` library installed, you will get an error. Go back and install this first using `install.packages("remotes")`, then run `remotes::install_github("cis-ds/rcis")`.

```{r}
#| label = "scorecard"
library(rcis)
data("scorecard")
glimpse(scorecard)
```

{{% callout note %}}

`glimpse()` is part of the `tibble` package and is a transposed version of `print()`: columns run down the page, and data runs across. With a data frame with multiple columns, sometimes there is not enough horizontal space on the screen to print each column. By transposing the data frame, we can see all the columns and the values recorded for the initial rows.

Type `?scorecard` in the console to open up the help file for this data set. This includes the documentation for all the variables. Use your knowledge of the `dplyr` functions to perform the following tasks.

## Generate a data frame of schools with a greater than 40% share of first-generation students

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r}
#| label = "filter"
filter(.data = scorecard, firstgen > .40)
```

## Generate a data frame with the 10 most expensive colleges in 2018-19 based on net cost of attendance

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

We could use a combination of `arrange()` and `slice()` to sort the data frame from most to least expensive, then keep the first 10 rows:

```{r}
#| label = "top-10-arrange-slice"
arrange(.data = scorecard, desc(netcost)) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

We can also use the `slice_max()` function in `dplyr` to accomplish the same thing in one line of code.

```{r}
#| label = "top-10-top-n"
slice_max(.data = scorecard, order_by = netcost, n = 10)
```

## Generate a data frame with the average SAT score for each type of college

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r}
#| label = "highest-sat"
scorecard %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarize(mean_sat = mean(satavg, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Calculate for each school how many students it takes to pay the average faculty member's salary and generate a data frame with the school's name and the calculated value

Note: use the net cost of attendance.

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r}
#| label = "avg-sal"
scorecard %>%
  mutate(ratio = avgfacsal / netcost) %>%
  select(name, ratio)
```

## Calculate how many private, nonprofit schools have a smaller net cost than Cornell University

Hint: the result should be a data frame with one row for Cornell University, and a column containing the requested value.

### Report the number as the total number of schools

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r}
#| label = "uchicago-raw"
scorecard %>%
  filter(type == "Private, nonprofit") %>%
  arrange(netcost) %>%
  # use row_number() but subtract 1 since Cornell is not cheaper than itself
  mutate(school_cheaper = row_number() - 1) %>%
  filter(name == "Cornell University") %>%
  glimpse()
```

### Report the number as the percentage of schools

{{< spoiler text="Click for the solution" >}}

```{r}
#| label = "uchicago-pct"
scorecard %>%
  filter(type == "Private, nonprofit") %>%
  mutate(netcost_rank = percent_rank(netcost)) %>%
  filter(name == "Cornell University") %>%
  glimpse()
```
