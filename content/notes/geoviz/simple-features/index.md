Rather than storing spatial data as [raster image files](/notes/raster-maps-with-ggmap/) which are not easily modifiable, we can instead store spatial data  as **vector** files. Vector files store the underlying geographical features (e.g. points, lines, polygons) as numerical data which software such as R can import and use to draw a map.

There are [many popular file formats for storing spatial data.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats#Popular_GIS_file_formats) Here we will look at two common file types, **shapefiles** and **GeoJSON**.

## Shapefile

**Shapefiles** are a commonly supported file type for spatial data dating back to the early 1990s. Proprietary software for geographic information systems (GIS) such as [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview) pioneered this format and helps maintain its continued usage. A shapefile encodes points, lines, and polygons in geographic space, and is actually a set of files. Shapefiles appear with a `.shp` extension, sometimes with accompanying files ending in `.dbf` and `.prj`.

* `.shp` stores the geographic coordinates of the geographic features (e.g. country, state, county)
* `.dbf` stores data associated with the geographic features (e.g. unemployment rate, crime rates, percentage of votes cast for Donald Trump)
* `.prj` stores information about the projection of the coordinates in the shapefile

When importing a shapefile, you need to ensure all the files are in the same folder. For example, here is the structure of the [Census Bureau's 2013 state boundaries shapefile](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php):




```
## -- cb_2013_us_county_20m.dbf
## -- cb_2013_us_county_20m.prj
## -- cb_2013_us_county_20m.shp
## -- cb_2013_us_county_20m.shp.iso.xml
## -- cb_2013_us_county_20m.shp.xml
## -- cb_2013_us_county_20m.shx
## -- county_20m.ea.iso.xml
```

**This is the complete shapefile.** If any of these files are missing, you will get an error importing your shapefile:

```
## Error in CPL_read_ogr(dsn, layer, query, as.character(options), quiet, : Open failed.
```

## GeoJSON

**GeoJSON** is a newer format for encoding a variety of geographical data structures using the **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation (JSON) file format. JSON formatted data is frequently used in web development and services. We will explore it in more detail when we get to [collecting data from the web.](/notes/write-an-api-function/#intro-to-json-and-xml) An example of a GeoJSON file is below:

```json
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Dinagat Islands"
  }
}
```

GeoJSON files are plain text files and can contain many different types of geometric features.

## Simple features

[There are a crap ton of packages for R that allow you to interact with shapefiles and spatial data.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) Here we will focus on a modern package for reading and transforming spatial data in a tidy format.

{{< figure src="allison_horst_art/sf.png" caption="Artwork by @allisonhorst" >}}

[Simple features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) or [**simple feature access**](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa) refers to a formal standard that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in computers, with emphasis on the **spatial** geometry of these objects. It also describes how such objects can be stored in and retrieved from databases, and which geometrical operations should be defined for them.

The standard is widely implemented in spatial databases (such as PostGIS), commercial GIS (e.g., [ESRI ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/)) and forms the vector data basis for libraries such as [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/). A subset of simple features forms the [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) standard.

R has well-supported classes for storing spatial data ([`sp`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp)) and interfacing to the above mentioned environments ([`rgdal`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal), [`rgeos`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgeos)), but has so far lacked a complete implementation of simple features, making conversions at times convoluted, inefficient or incomplete. The [`sf`](http://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package tries to fill this gap.

## What is a feature?

A **feature** is a thing or an object in the real world. Often features will consist of a set of features. For instance, a tree can be a feature but a set of trees can form a forest which is itself a feature. Features have **geometry** describing where on Earth the feature is located. They also have attributes, which describe other properties of the feature.

### Dimensions

All geometries are composed of points. Points are coordinates in a 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional space. All points in a geometry have the same dimensionality. In addition to X and Y coordinates, there are two optional additional dimensions:

* a Z coordinate, denoting altitude
* an M coordinate (rarely used), denoting some **measure** that is associated with the point, rather than with the feature as a whole (in which case it would be a feature attribute); examples could be time of measurement, or measurement error of the coordinates

The four possible cases then are:

1. two-dimensional points refer to x and y, easting and northing, or longitude and latitude, we refer to them as XY
2. three-dimensional points as XYZ
3. three-dimensional points as XYM
4. four-dimensional points as XYZM (the third axis is Z, fourth M)

### Simple feature geometry types

{{< figure src="simple-features.png" caption="Source: [Simple Features for R](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html#sf-objects-with-simple-features-1)" >}}

The following seven simple feature types are the most common, and are for instance the only ones used for [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946):

| type | description                                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `POINT` | zero-dimensional geometry containing a single point |
| `LINESTRING` | sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces; one-dimensional geometry |
| `POLYGON` | geometry with a positive area (two-dimensional); sequence of points form a closed, non-self intersecting ring; the first ring denotes the exterior ring, zero or more subsequent rings denote holes in this exterior ring |
| `MULTIPOINT` | set of points; a MULTIPOINT is simple if no two Points in the MULTIPOINT are equal |
| `MULTILINESTRING` | set of linestrings |
| `MULTIPOLYGON` | set of polygons |
| `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` | set of geometries of any type except GEOMETRYCOLLECTION |

### Coordinate reference system

Coordinates can only be placed on the Earth's surface when their coordinate reference system (CRS) is known; this may be an spheroid CRS such as WGS84, a projected, two-dimensional (Cartesian) CRS such as a UTM zone or Web Mercator, or a CRS in three-dimensions, or including time. Similarly, M-coordinates need an attribute reference system, e.g. a [measurement unit](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=units).

### Simple features in R

`sf` stores simple features as basic R data structures (lists, matrix, vectors, etc.). The typical data structure stores geometric and feature attributes as a data frame with one row per feature. However since feature geometries are not single-valued, they are put in a **list-column** with each list element holding the simple feature geometry of that feature.

## Importing spatial data using `sf`

`st_read()` imports a spatial data file and converts it to a simple feature data frame. Here we import a shapefile containing the spatial boundaries of each [borough in New York City](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm).


```r
nyc_shape <- here("static", "data", "borough-boundaries") %>%
  st_read()
```

```
## Reading layer `geo_export_6fd95df5-1136-4829-8f2d-9cb5d1cc2222' from data source `/Users/soltoffbc/Projects/Computing for Social Sciences/course-site/static/data/borough-boundaries' 
##   using driver `ESRI Shapefile'
## Simple feature collection with 5 features and 4 fields
## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
## Dimension:     XY
## Bounding box:  xmin: -74.3 ymin: 40.5 xmax: -73.7 ymax: 40.9
## Geodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)
```

The short report printed gives the file name, mentions that there are 5 features (records, represented as rows) and 5 fields (attributes, represented as columns), states that the spatial data file is a `MULTIPOLYGON`, provides the bounding box coordinates, and identifies the projection method (which we will discuss later). If we print the first rows of `nyc_shape`:


```r
nyc_shape
```

```
## Simple feature collection with 5 features and 4 fields
## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
## Dimension:     XY
## Bounding box:  xmin: -74.3 ymin: 40.5 xmax: -73.7 ymax: 40.9
## Geodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)

## 2         2         Bronx   1.19e+09     463277 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.9 40.8,...
## 3         1     Manhattan   6.37e+08     359103 MULTIPOLYGON (((-74 40.7, -...
## 4         3      Brooklyn   1.93e+09     728478 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.9 40.6,...
## 5         4        Queens   3.04e+09     888239 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.8 40.6,...
```

In the output we see:

* Each row is a simple feature: a single record, or `data.frame` row, consisting of attributes and geometry
* The `geometry` column is a simple feature list-column (an object of class `sfc`, which is a column in the `data.frame`)
* Each value in `geometry` is a single simple feature geometry (an object of class `sfg`)

We start to recognize the data frame structure. Substantively, `boro_name` defines the name of the borough for each row.

`st_read()` also works with GeoJSON files.


```r
nyc_json <- here("static", "data", "borough-boundaries.geojson") %>%
  st_read()
```
