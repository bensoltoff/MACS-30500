#| out.height = "70%",
#| out.width = "70%",
#| fig.width = 5
include_graphics(path = "https://i.imgflip.com/1szkun.jpg")
```

---

## Automation

* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

---

## Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

---

## Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box)
* Version control software
    * Repository

## Documentation

* *Comments* are the what
* *Code* is the how
* Computer code should also be *self-documenting*
* Future-proofing

---

## Badly documented code

```{r}
#| label = "sesame-bad",
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)
tml1 <- get_timeline("MeCookieMonster", 3000)
tml2 <- get_timeline("Grover", 3000)
tml3 <- get_timeline("elmo", 3000)
tml4 <- get_timeline("CountVonCount", 3000)
ts_plot(group_by(bind_rows(select(tml1, created_at), select(tml2, created_at), select(tml3, created_at), select(tml4, created_at), .id = "screen_name"), screen_name), by = "months")
```

---

## Good code

```{r}
#| label = "rtweet-auth",
#| include = FALSE,
#| cache = FALSE
library(rtweet)

# retrieve stored bearer token
auth_as("cfss")
```

.tiny[
```{r}
#| label = "sesame-good",
#| eval = FALSE,
#| echo = TRUE
# get_to_sesame_street.R
# Program to retrieve recent tweets from Sesame Street characters

# load packages for data management and Twitter API
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)

# retrieve most recent 3000 tweets of best Sesame Street residents
cookie <- get_timeline(
  user = "MeCookieMonster",
  n = 3000
)

grover <- get_timeline(
  user = "Grover",
  n = 3000
)

elmo <- get_timeline(
  user = "elmo",
  n = 3000
)

count_von_count <- get_timeline(
  user = "CountVonCount",
  n = 3000
)

# combine, group by character, and plot weekly tweet frequency
bind_rows(
  `Cookie Monster` = cookie %>% select(created_at),
  Grover = grover %>% select(created_at),
  Elmo = elmo %>% select(created_at),
  `Count von Count` = count_von_count %>% select(created_at),
  .id = "screen_name"
) %>%
  group_by(screen_name) %>%
  ts_plot(by = "months")
```
]

## Good code

```{r}
#| ref.label = "sesame-good",
