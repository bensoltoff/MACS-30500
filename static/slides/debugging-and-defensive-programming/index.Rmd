## Bugs

> An error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

* Computers are powerful tools that are incredibly stupid
* Debugging has two goals:
    1. Prevent bugs from occurring in the first place
    1. Fix bugs once they occur

We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.

And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them....

The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

## Calling functions

```r
library(purrr)
map()
```

--

```r
library(purrr)
library(maps)

map()
```

---

## `::` notation

```r
library(purrr)
library(maps)

purrr::map()    # use map() from the purrr library
maps::map()     # use map() from the maps library
```

--

```r
library(purrr)

map()           # use map() from the purrr library
maps::map()     # use map() from the maps library
```

## Auto-formatting in RStudio

* **Code > Reformat Code** (Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + A)
* **Code > Reindent Lines** (Cmd/Ctrl + I)
* [`styler`](http://styler.r-lib.org/)

# Condition handling

---

## Fatal errors

```{r}
#| label = "error",
#| error = TRUE,
#| warning = FALSE
addition <- function(x, y){
  if(!is_numeric(c(x, y))) stop("One of your inputs is not a number.")
  
  x + y
}

addition(3, "abc")
```

---

## Warnings

```{r}
#| label = "logit",
#| error = TRUE
logit <- function(x){
  log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

---

## Warnings

```{r}
#| label = "logit_error",
#| error = TRUE
logit <- function(x){
 if (x < 0 | x > 1) stop('x not between 0 and 1')
 log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

---

## Warnings

```{r}
#| label = "logit_warning"
logit <- function(x){
  x <- if_else(x < 0 | x > 1, NA_real_, x)
  if (is.na(x)) warning('x not between 0 and 1')
  log(x / (1 - x))
}

logit(-1)
```

---

## Messages

```{r}
#| label = "message_ggplot",
#| out.width = "55%"
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

---

## Suppressing messages

```{r}
#| label = "message_print"
demo_message <- function() message("This is a message")
demo_message()
suppressMessages(demo_message())  # no output

demo_print <- function() print("This is a message")
demo_print()
suppressMessages(demo_print())  # still output
```

---

## Exercise: build a function with conditions

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
include_graphics(path = "https://media.giphy.com/media/5EJHDSPpFhbG0/giphy.gif")
```

```{r}
#| cache = FALSE,
#| echo = FALSE
countdown(minutes = 10)
```

---

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.alt = "A cartoon of a fuzzy round monster face showing 10 different emotions
#| experienced during the process of debugging code. The progression goes from (1) 'I
#| got this' - looking determined and optimistic; (2) 'Huh. Really thought that was it.'
#| - looking a bit baffled; (3) '...' - looking up at the ceiling in thought; (4) 'Fine.
#| Restarting.' - looking a bit annoyed; (5) 'OH WTF.' Looking very frazzled and
#| frustrated; (6) 'Zombie meltdown.' - looking like a full meltdown; (7) (blank) -
#| sleeping; (8) 'A NEW HOPE!' - a happy looking monster with a lightbulb above; (9)
#| 'insert awesome theme song' - looking determined and typing away; (10) 'I love
#| coding' - arms raised in victory with a big smile, with confetti falling."

## Debugging techniques

1. Realize that you have a bug
1. Make it repeatable
1. Figure out where it is
1. Fix it and test it

---

## The call stack

```{r}
#| label = "callstack",
#| error = TRUE
f <- function(a) g(a)
g <- function(b) h(b)
h <- function(c) i(c)
i <- function(d) "a" + d
f(10)
```

```{r}
#| label = "traceback",
#| eval = FALSE
traceback()
```

```
# 4: i(c) at exceptions-example.R#3
# 3: h(b) at exceptions-example.R#2
# 2: g(a) at exceptions-example.R#1
# 1: f(10)
```

---

## Condition handling

* Unexpected errors
* Expected errors
* `safely()`

---

## Dealing with failure using `safely()`

* Adverb
* Always returns a list with two elements
    1. `result`
    1. `error`

---

## Dealing with failure using `safely()`

```{r}
#| label = "sqrt_safely"
safe_sqrt <- safely(sqrt)
str(safe_sqrt(9))
str(safe_sqrt("a"))
```

---

## `safely()` and `map()`

```{r}
#| label = "safely_map",
#| error = TRUE,
#| collapse = TRUE
x <- list("a", 4, 5)

# unsafely square root
y <- map(x, sqrt)

# safely log
y <- map(x, safely(sqrt))
str(y)
```

---

## `transpose()`

```{r}
#| label = "transpose"
y <- transpose(y)
str(y)
```

---

## Exercise: handle conditions using `safely()`

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
include_graphics(path = "https://media.giphy.com/media/VFDeGtRSHswfe/giphy.gif")
```

```{r}
#| cache = FALSE,
#| echo = FALSE
countdown(minutes = 5)
```
