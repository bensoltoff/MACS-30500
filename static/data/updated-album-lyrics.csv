Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,And if it was an open-shut case
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I never would've known from that look on your face
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Lost in your current like a priceless wine
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"The more that you say, the less I know"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wherever you stray, I follow"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,As if you were a mythical thing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"The more that you say, the less I know"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wherever you stray, I follow"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,You know that my train could take you home
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Anywhere else is hollow
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,They count me out time and time again
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Now this is an open-shut case
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"The more that you say, the less I know"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wherever you stray, I follow"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,You know that my train could take you home
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Anywhere else is hollow
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"The more that you say, the less I know"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wherever you stray, I follow"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,You know that my train could take you home
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Anywhere else is hollow
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Hey, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,That's my man
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Yeah, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,That's my man
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Hey, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,I'm begging for you to take my hand
Taylor Swift,evermore,​willow,"Wreck my plans, that's my man"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,You booked the night train for a reason
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,So you could sit there in this hurt
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,You're not sure which is worse
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Left you out there standing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Crestfallen on the landing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Your mom's ring in your pocket
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,My picture in your wallet
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"Your heart was glass, I dropped it"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,You told your family for a reason
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,You couldn't keep it in
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Now no one's celebrating
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"Dom Pérignon, you brought it"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,No crowd of friends applauded
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Your hometown skeptics called it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"You had a speech, you're speechless"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Love slipped beyond your reaches
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,And I couldn't give a reason
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,November flush and your flannel cure
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"""This dorm was once a madhouse"""
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me"""
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"How evergreen, our group of friends"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Don't think we'll say that word again
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,That we once walked through
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"One for the money, two for the show"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,I never was ready so I watch you go
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Sometimes you just don't know the answer
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"""She would've made such a lovely bride"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,"What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,But you'll find the real thing instead
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,And hold your hand while dancing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Never leave you standing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Crestfallen on the landing
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,With champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Your mom's ring in your pocket
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Her picture in your wallet
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,You won't remember all my
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,You won't remember all my
Taylor Swift,evermore,​champagne problems,Champagne problems
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"Gleaming, twinkling"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Eyes like sinking ships on waters
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"So inviting, I almost jump in"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Everybody wants you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"Walk past, quick brush"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Everybody wants you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,But I don't like a gold rush
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,With your hair falling into place like dominoes
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I see me padding across your wooden floors
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,'Cause it could never be
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Everybody wants you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"Walk past, quick brush"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Everybody wants you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,But I don't like a gold rush
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,With your hair falling into place like dominoes
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,My mind turns your life into folklore
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,I can't dare to dream about you anymore
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,'Cause it will never be
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"Gleaming, twinkling"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,Eyes like sinking ships on waters
Taylor Swift,evermore,​gold rush,"So inviting, I almost jump in"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I sit and watch you reading with your head low
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I sit and watch you
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I notice everything you do or don't do
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"You're so much older and wiser, and I"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Use my best colors for your portrait
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Lay the table with the fancy shit
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,And watch you tolerate it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"If it's all in my head, tell me now"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I know my love should be celebrated
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,But you tolerate it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I take your indiscretions all in good fun
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,You're so much older and wiser and I
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Use my best colors for your portrait
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Lay the table with the fancy shit
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,And watch you tolerate it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"If it's all in my head, tell me now"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I know my love should be celebrated
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,But you tolerate it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"While you were out building other worlds, where was I?"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"I made you my temple, my mural, my sky"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Drawing hearts in the byline
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Always taking up too much space or time
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Break free and leave us in ruins
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Took this dagger in me and removed it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"Gain the weight of you, then lose it"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"Believe me, I could do it"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,"If it's all in my head, tell me now"
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I know my love should be celebrated
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,But you tolerate it
Taylor Swift,evermore,​tolerate it,I sit and watch you
